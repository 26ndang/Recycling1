<h2> What is recycling? </h2>

<p> Recycling is the process of breaking down different materials to reuse them. 
  This helps save our resources. Most things that people recycle are made into new things and used over and over again.</p>

    <h2> Why is Recycling Important?</h2>
    <p> Things that are not recyclable end up in the landfill. This is bad because trash in landfills just 
      sits there, letting off <strong>methane</strong> gas while they very slowly break down. Methane gas and the
      other harmful gases it lets off harms the environment and the toxins pollute the air that we 
      breathe and the water that we drink. Lots of things we throw away to go in the landfill can be 
      recycled and saved from being wasted and turned into methane. The pollutants will be reduced if people recycle more.
      This also saves space for things that truly cannot be repurposed. </p>
    <h2> Recycling vs. Landfill </h2>
<p> Recycling breaks down materials to use again while items in the landfill sit there and turn into harmful methane gases. 
        Recycling is better for the environment because it saves our natural resources and reduces the amount of greenhouse gases in our air.</p>
