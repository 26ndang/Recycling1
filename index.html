    <h2> Why is Recycling Important?</h2>
    <p> Recycling breaks down materials to use again while items in the landfill sit there and turn into harmful methane gases. Recycling is better for the environment because it saves our natural resources and reduces the amount of greenhouse gases in our air.</p>
